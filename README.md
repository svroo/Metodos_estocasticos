# Metodos estocasticos

In this repository you gona have a python's code for some excercise that I did in my class.

In the R directory you gonna look a R code, from Stochastic Processes with R An Introduction By Olga Korosteleva book, this code did it in team, you gonna have a code for problems and code from examples.

For the project directory, you have a jupyter's notebook, in this notebook I did a prediction of Tesla's price, first I got the close's price, then I simulate a Geometric Brownian motion where initial value is a initial value from close's price of Tesla. I simulate for 1250 days approximately. Then I do a plot the simulate and real values for comparate it.
